        "Open Bandit Dataset is constructed in an A/B test of two multi-armed bandit policies on a large-scale fashion e-commerce platform, ZOZOTOWN. It currently consists of a total of about 26M rows, each one representing a user impression with some feature values, selected items as actions, true propensity scores, and click indicators as an outcome. This is especially suitable for evaluating off-policy evaluation (OPE), which attempts to estimate the counterfactual performance of hypothetical algorithms using data generated by a different algorithm.\n",

        "OBD is a set of logged bandit feedback datasets collected on a largescale fashion e-commerce platform provided by Saito et al. There are three campaigns, \"ALL\", \"Men\", and \"Women\". We use size 30,000 and 300,000 of randomly sub-sampled data from the \"ALL\" campaign. The dataset contains user context as feature vector ùë• ‚àà X, fashion item recommendation as action ùëé ‚àà A, and click indicator as reward ùëü ‚àà {0, 1}. The dimensions of the feature vector ùë• is 20, and the number of actions is 80. \n",
